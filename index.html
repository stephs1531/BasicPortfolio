        <p>The important stuff:<br>
            I am an interactive designer from Atlanta, GA. At my high school art show, an anonymous judge said I might
            make
            a good designer someday, so I have spent my life since then working towards perfecting my design skills.
        </p>
        <p>The cool stuff:<br>
            I am a kick-ass horseback rider and was nationally ranked when I was actively competing. I also love
            ashtanga
            and acro-yoga and do scratchboard art whenever I get a chance.
        </p>
        <p>The weird stuff:<br>
            The first concert I ever went to was The Cheetah Girls. I was older than I care to admit.<br>
            I am an easy-mac connoisseur and a total snob when it comes to brands of microwavable macaroni and
            cheese.<br>
            I have a parrot who is older than me and likes to cat-call whistle to people walking
